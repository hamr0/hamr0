# adaptlearn ↔ cybernetics — the frame, registered

**Status:** theoretical frame, not a finding. Registered 2026-07-10 **before** the SP-3 (F17)
readout (run at g7, 61/64 cells logged, at time of writing) so its one prediction counts as a
pre-registration, not a post-hoc gloss. Sources: Wiener *Cybernetics* (1948), Ashby *Design
for a Brain* (1952) / *An Introduction to Cybernetics* (1956), Conant & Ashby (1970), Beer
*Brain of the Firm* (1972), von Foerster (second-order cybernetics), Davies *The
Unaccountability Machine* (2024). Nothing here reopens the archive verdict; the frame names
what the experiment found empirically and points at what the successor should validate.

Reading rule: the frame earns its keep only where it **predicts or budgets**, never where it
merely renames. Each mapping below is tagged `[confirms]` (doctrine already earned the hard
way), `[predicts]` (testable, see V-items), or `[budgets]` (turns a doctrine into an
accounting rule).

> **Addendum 2026-07-11** (§"The VSM ladder in full", V7–V8): registered after F21/F22 and the
> upstream-ledger feature — mappings citing those are `[confirms]` (post-hoc naming of earned
> results); the bareloop-facing items are predictions for the successor repo and count as
> pre-registration there.

## The core mappings

### 1. Ashby's Law of Requisite Variety = the F16 result `[confirms]`

Ashby: a regulator can only control disturbances whose variety it can match — "only variety
can absorb variety." F16's rewrite (masking variable is *guessability*, not worker capability)
is this law restated: a guessable regularity is a disturbance within the worker's own variety
(priors + cap-3 retries of search); an idiosyncratic convention exceeds it, so regulation is
only possible by importing variety from outside — the notes, the memory store. The boundary
map is a requisite-variety map: masked terrain = disturbance ⊆ regulator's internal variety.

### 2. Conant–Ashby theorem predicts SP-3's Q2 outright `[predicts]`

"Every good regulator of a system must be a model of that system" (Conant & Ashby 1970). A
config that reliably greens on sp3 tasks *must contain* the idiosyncratic rules somewhere —
and since the notes are the only declared path to them, the only good regulator is an
episode-wired one. Registered reading (see F17 addendum): Q1 ∧ Q2 = a Conant–Ashby
demonstration; Q1 ∧ ¬Q2 = the model got in through an undeclared channel — **search for the
leak first** (§4b precedent, learned twice) before concluding the F16 map is wrong again.

### 3. The credit-attribution gap is a channel-capacity problem `[budgets]`

Selection steering over N knobs needs ~log₂N bits of *attributable* information per decision
from the feedback channel. A bare green is ~1 bit, confounded across every knob at once —
attributable capacity ≈ 0. That is why gated-rules authored episode-recall at g0, greened,
and lost it by g1 (F16): the channel physically could not carry the which-knob signal. A
contrast pair is a one-bit channel *aimed at one knob* — it mints an attributable bit.
"Verdict admits, contrast attributes" is Shannon/Ashby: attribution requires requisite variety
in the feedback channel. Budget rule for the successor: **≥1 contrast bit per knob claimed**,
counted the way dollars are counted.

### 4. Beer's algedonic channel = cap-halt and HITL escalation `[confirms → predicts]`

In the Viable System Model, algedonic (pain/pleasure) signals bypass the management hierarchy
straight to System 5, because routine channels attenuate exactly the signals that matter most.
§5b already treats cap-halt as its own category, never folded into the verdict axis — keep
that *structural*, not just doctrinal. Successor requirement: HITL escalations must reach the
human by a path **no emergent component summarizes**; anything routed through the normal
ledger gets attenuated by whatever reads the ledger.

### 5. VSM maps the three-layer shape — and names one gap `[confirms → predicts]`

Ralph shell = System 5 (identity/policy, deliberately dumb, outside the adaptive parts).
Interpreter + worker = System 1 (operations). Gate = System 3 (audit/control). Mutation +
selection = System 4 (intelligence, facing the future). The gap Beer insists on: System 4
needs a **model of the environment**, kept current, distinct from operations — and the
environment includes *every channel property*. SP-2's provider-path non-invariance (same
model+config+notes behave differently CLI vs raw API) is that model being forced into
existence. VSM predicts it generalizes: any channel change (close wording, task framing,
scaffold) is an environment change; inherited harnesses are not presumed portable across it.

### 6. Ashby's ultrastability = the two-loop architecture `[confirms]`

The homeostat's double feedback: a fast loop (behave within current parameters) and a slow
loop (when equilibrium is unreachable, step the parameters themselves, then fully re-test).
That is within-run iteration (M2/M5) vs across-run one-knob mutation (M6) — including the
convergence conditions Ashby proved necessary: re-test under the same conditions ("mutant must
stay green and dominate on cost") and an incorruptible equilibrium detector ("the agent never
authors its arbiter").

### 7. POSIWID = the fit-to-pass doctrine `[confirms]`

Beer: "the purpose of a system is what it does." Davies builds the accountability-sink
argument on it: a structure that severs decisions from consequences. "The agent never authors
its arbiter" is sink-prevention; a confident fake green *is* a sink. M6 attempt 2 was pure
POSIWID: whatever the design intent, the system-as-built was a device for teaching the
regularity to all arms through the close channel — and it did (F14, §4b).

## The VSM ladder in full (Davies 2024, ch. 5 "Cybernetics Without Diagrams") — completes mapping 5

Davies' plain-English decomposition: a viable organization is five interlocking subsystems —
S1 operations (the doers), S2 regulation (the schedulers: anti-friction protocols between S1
units), S3 here-and-now optimization (efficiency, metrics, the present), S4 there-and-then
intelligence (the environment, the future), S5 identity (who we are; the anchor that manages
the S3↔S4 tension) — plus two dynamics: **variety engineering** (attenuate upward, amplify
the front line) and **S5 collapse** (when identity is hollowed out to a single metric, S3
optimizes without constraint, S4 is disempowered, and the organization becomes a blind,
unaccountable machine). Mapping 5 above used S1/S3/S4/S5; the full ladder adds three things
this project can actually use:

### 5a. System 2 is the successor's missing subsystem `[predicts → V7]`

adaptlearn never needed an S2: one process, one S1 unit, sequential runs — nothing to
coordinate (the validator and slot rules are proto-S2 at most: "administrative rules the
doers agree prevent chaos," Davies' phrase almost verbatim). bareloop's real shape — multi-
step jobs, shared store, several primitives touching one repo — creates the first genuine S2
demand: write-scope partitioning, step ordering, store-access conventions, the bareagent
Scheduler. Beer's warning, Davies' rendering: S2 failures present as *friction between
healthy units* (oscillation, contention, units undoing each other), which none of the
existing red categories name — worker-red, interpreter-red, gate-red all blame a unit, not a
coordination. Prediction: the first multi-step job will surface reds that are S2-class, and
folding them into worker-red will misattribute exactly the way counting reds without §5b
contrast did.

### 5b′. S5 collapse = the single-fitness-score smell, named structurally `[confirms → budgets → V8]`

Davies' diagnosis of Friedmanite shareholder-value: when S5's whole identity becomes one
maximizable number, S3 devours S4 and the machine goes blind. That is *precisely* the
doctrine "green gates, cost ranks — **never one fitness score** (efficiency must not negotiate
with truth)": verdict is S5/identity territory (what counts as done), cost is S3 territory
(how efficiently), and collapsing them into one scalar is the S5 collapse in miniature —
fit-to-pass is Friedmanism for harnesses. Two existing results are this mapping earned:
"improvement is nobody's goal" (the learning curve stays an observer's reading — S3's metric
is never promoted into S5's identity), and F20's honest bound (ungated inheritance looked
fine for 8 calm generations — Davies: the collapsed machine fails on *environmental shock*,
not on calm seas, so short windows structurally cannot show the cost). Budget rule for
bareloop (V8): make the collapse unrepresentable, not just discouraged — selection code takes
verdict and cost as separate arguments and no function may combine them into one scalar.

### 5c. Variety engineering, both directions — now with post-frame evidence `[confirms]`

Davies: healthy organizations **attenuate upward** (summaries that survive compression) and
**amplify the front line** (equip S1 to absorb the unexpected locally). Both halves now have
earned instances that postdate this frame's registration:

- **Amplification = the primitive menu.** F21: admitting one structural verb (`impact`)
  flipped 0/3 cap-halt to 3/3 green@1 — variety imported to S1 exactly where the task's
  disturbance exceeded the worker's own (mapping 1, new axis). F21's sharpest lesson is
  Davies-shaped too: *partial* amplification is worse than none informationally — 4-of-8
  callers gave the worker false confidence of completeness and it discarded true feedback
  (attribution poisoning). Amplifiers must be exhaustive over their declared scope or
  declare their truncation (cf. the ledger doctrine: ABSENT, not fabricated).
- **Attenuation = the upstream ledger.** The fold (dedupe by lib:verb:class:signature,
  counts, three samples) is an attenuator designed against Beer's question in the toolbox
  entry below — *what information is destroyed, and does anything downstream need it?* —
  answered per field: identity of the bug survives (signature), scale survives (count),
  drill-down survives (samples → exact spine seqs), and everything else is reconstructible
  from the spines, which stay ground truth. Close reds and bare cap-halts are attenuated to
  zero *deliberately* (workflow stories, not lib incidents) — attenuation as a design
  decision with named exclusions, not lossy accident.
- **The asymmetry F22 adds:** S1's appetite is not a variety signal. Authors grab every
  amplifier offered (cargo-cult, 6/6 on inert tasks) — so amplification decisions must key on
  evidence from the ledger (request-red frequency under failure, green@1-vs-grind contrast),
  never on the front line's stated wants. Davies' managers who mistake requisition volume
  for requisite variety are the same failure.

### 5d. Recursion: every step of a bareloop job is itself a viable system `[predicts]`

Davies stresses VSM is recursive — each S1 unit contains the whole five-system ladder at its
own scale. bareloop's per-step verdict classes (hard/soft/HITL green, gated PER STEP) are
this recursion made concrete: each step has its own close (its S5 boundary), its own budget
slice (S3), its own escalation (algedonic). The prediction worth carrying: step-level
viability does not compose into job-level viability for free — the job needs its own S2
(step coordination) and its own S5 (the human merge line), or the steps will be individually
green and jointly incoherent. Never tested anywhere; job #1 is the test.

## Shorter refs — the rest of the toolbox

- **Wiener — feedback vs feedforward.** Error-driven correction (feedback) vs model-driven
  anticipation (feedforward). The retry loop is feedback; recalled notes are feedforward.
  SP-3 is literally a feedback-starvation test: when disturbances are unguessable, feedback
  alone fails and feedforward is the only route. Diagnostic this suggests: classify every
  green as feedback-reached (iterations > 1, no recall evidence) vs feedforward-reached
  (recall + green@1) — computable from the existing ledger. `[predicts → V6]`
- **Wiener — hunting/oscillation.** An error-driven loop with too much gain and no damping
  oscillates around the target without converging. Cap-3 is the damper; a lineage that
  cap-halts repeatedly on the same task is *hunting*, and more retries would buy oscillation,
  not convergence — visible in F15's 0/44 green@1 vs 0.73 eventual green (slow guessing, not
  hunting) as the contrast case. `[confirms]`
- **Ashby — the black-box method.** Regulate by observed behavior; never require the box be
  opened. The opaque close (attempt 3's declared condition) is the black-box discipline
  applied to the arbiter's *output*: counts only, no teaching. `[confirms]`
- **von Foerster — second-order cybernetics.** The observer is part of the system observed.
  §4b ("every information path into the worker is part of the instrument"), earned twice, is
  second-order cybernetics rediscovered: the experimenter's close wording, catalog notes, and
  task framing are all *in* the system under test. `[confirms]`
- **von Foerster — order from noise.** Self-organization needs a noise source whose variety
  matches the search space. Mutation is the noise source; attempt 1's ceiling (authorship
  saturated the catalog space, F13) was an order-from-noise failure — the noise had too little
  variety left to generate order. Pre-flight rule: check the mutation operator's remaining
  variety against the space before any cohort. `[budgets → V5]`
- **Beer — variety engineering (attenuators & amplifiers).** Every management structure is a
  chain of variety attenuators (filters) and amplifiers (structure). The extractor is an
  attenuator: episode → rule compresses variety. The credit-attribution gap is
  over-attenuation — a bare green destroys the which-knob information in transit. Design
  question the frame keeps live: at every attenuation point in the successor (extractor,
  ledger summary, escalation text), *what information is destroyed, and does anything
  downstream need it?* `[budgets]`
- **Pask — conversation theory / teach-back.** A concept is held only if it can be taught
  back in the learner's own terms. Rules-vs-verbatim is a teach-back experiment: verbatim
  inheritance copies the utterance; rules inheritance requires the regularity be re-expressed
  — and F12/F15 showed the rules channel steers authorship both directions, i.e. the
  teach-back transmits. `[confirms]`

## V-items — what the frame says to validate or try (registered)

- **V1 (SP-3 readout rule, pre-registered at g7):** read the readout Conant–Ashby-first.
  Q1 ∧ Q2 → record as a good-regulator demonstration. Q1 ∧ ¬Q2 → *before* firing the F17
  commitment (b) ("map wrong again"), run an explicit leak search: enumerate every channel by
  which the idiosyncratic rules could have reached a no-episode worker (task text, close
  output, authoring notes, catalog, CLI scaffold). Only a clean search fires the commitment.
- **V2 (successor, extractor):** formalize contrast evidence as channel capacity — the
  extractor may claim a knob only with ≥1 attributable contrast bit for it, counted
  mechanically from the ledger (sibling standing, not bare greens). Amend the successor design
  doc; validate that bits are countable from the existing cohort ledgers retroactively (F16's
  lost-credit case should show 0 bits; F15's L1 lock should show ≥1).
- **V3 (successor, lineage key):** generalize SP-2 — the lineage key must be extensible to any
  *declared channel condition*, not hardcoded to (job × worker path). Every condition.json
  field is a candidate key dimension.
- **V4 (successor, escalation):** algedonic path — HITL escalations travel a channel no
  emergent component writes, summarizes, or filters. Structural, testable: an escalation's
  text reaching the human must be byte-identical to what the shell emitted.
- **V5 (any future cohort):** order-from-noise pre-flight — before spending tokens, measure
  the mutation operator's remaining variety against the config space (attempt-1 ceiling class,
  F13). A catalog the authoring channel can saturate first-shot has zero noise left.
- **V6 (grid script, now):** feedback/feedforward classification per green —
  feedforward-reached = recall-evidence ∧ green@1; feedback-reached = iterations > 1 ∧ no
  recall evidence. Free from the existing ledger + spine; SP-3's Q3 lock prediction says late
  gated-arm greens should migrate feedforward while ungated stays feedback.
- **V7 (bareloop, first multi-step job):** System-2 red category — coordination failures
  between steps/units (write-scope contention, step-order violations, store races) get their
  own named category on the spine, never folded into worker-red/interpreter-red. Prediction
  (§5a): job #1 surfaces at least one red that is S2-class; if every red attributes cleanly
  to a single unit, the S2 mapping over-predicted — note it and move on.
- **V8 (bareloop, selection code):** the single-fitness-score ban made structural (§5b′) —
  verdict and cost travel as separate values end-to-end; no function in the selection path
  combines them into one scalar. Testable mechanically (type/lint the selection seam) and by
  review: any PR introducing a combined score is the S5-collapse smell, rejected on sight.
